# review-agent

This is a repository for the review agent where you can find the personlized restaurant from Agentic AI.

Currently, the review agent tackles the following problem
1. It is hard to decide which restaurant is suitable for you just from the review score on Google map, Yelp, Taberogu, etc because some people are more willing to give higher scores but those people might not have similar taste as you.
2. It is time consuming to read the reviews to find a restaurant that you might wanna go. The more reviews you read, the more you are confident if the restaurant is suitable for you but the time is limited.
3. The reviews might be affected by the wrong information that the restaurant has already improved upon. Thus, it is important to correct those biases so that you can find the current best restaurant. 

Hope you enjoy talking with the review agent and we are looking forward to hearing from how you felt!
